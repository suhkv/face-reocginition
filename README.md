# Emotions Feedback Engine
*1. Title:*
Emotions Feedback Engine â€“ An AI-based Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition System

*2. Introduction*
This project brings together computer vision and neural networks to build a practical solution that can:
â€¢	Understand what a user might be feeling.
â€¢	Provide instant human-like feedback.
â€¢	Be integrated into wider applications (mental health, education, user experience design).

*3. Methodology:*

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Preprocessing
â€¢	Normalize pixel values to [0,1]
â€¢	Convert images to grayscale (if required)
â€¢	Resize all images to 48x48 pixels
â€¢	Split data into training, validation, and testing sets

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Model Training

â€¢	Model architecture: 3 Conv layers + MaxPooling + Flatten + Dense + Softmax
â€¢	Activation: ReLU and Softmax
â€¢	Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
â€¢	Optimizer: Adam
â€¢	Epochs: 50+
â€¢	Evaluation: Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Real-Time Face Emotion Detection

â€¢	Capture real-time feed using OpenCV
â€¢	Detect face using HaarCascade/DNN
â€¢	Preprocess detected face region and predict emotion
â€¢	Display bounding box and predicted emotion on screen

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Feedback Engine

â€¢	Emotion mapped to textual feedback
â€¢	Shown via overlay, pop-up, or printed to terminal

*4. Scope for Future Work:*

â€¢	Voice Emotion Detection: Combine facial + audio emotion analysis.
â€¢	Multi-person Detection: Analyze group emotional behavior.
â€¢	Feedback Logging: Maintain emotional history over sessions.
â€¢	Integration: Plug into platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, or e-learning apps.
